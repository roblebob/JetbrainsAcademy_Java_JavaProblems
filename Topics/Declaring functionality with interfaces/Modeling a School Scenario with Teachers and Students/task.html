<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>In a school scenario, there is a 'Person' who can be a 'Teacher' or a 'Student'. A 'Teacher' teaches a 'Subject' while the 'Student' studies the 'Subject'. All 'Persons', whether they are 'Teacher' or 'Student', have a 'name' but only the 'Teacher' has a 'Subject' they teach and only the 'Student' has a 'Subject' they 'learn'. To model this in Java, declare an interface 'Person' with method 'getName()'. Also declare two classes 'Teacher' and 'Student' implementing 'Person'. 'Teacher' class should have a 'Subject they teach' and 'Student' class should have a 'Subject they learn'. For input, you will receive a series of strings representing the name and subject taught for a Teacher, as well as the name and subject learned for a Student, formatted as follows - "name:subject". For each name:subject pair, if the name starts with 'T', construct a Teacher object, if the name starts with 'S', construct a Student object. For output, print each constructed object's name and subject in this format: "name:subject".<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">T:John:Maths<br>S:Tom:Science</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Teacher: John Subject: Maths<br>Student: Tom Subject: Science</code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">T:Ann:English<br>S:Emma:History</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Teacher: Ann Subject: English<br>Student: Emma Subject: History</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
