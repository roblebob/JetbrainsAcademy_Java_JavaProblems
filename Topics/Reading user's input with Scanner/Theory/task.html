<h2>Reading user's input with Scanner</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>The <strong>standard input</strong> is a data stream going into a program and supported by the operating system. By default, the standard input acquires data from keyboard input, but it can be redirected from a file.</p><p>Not every program needs to use the standard input, but you'll use it frequently here to help master your programming skills! The typical approach to solving programming problems is:</p><ol><li><p>Read data from the standard input (System.in);</p></li><li><p>Process data to obtain a result;</p></li><li><p>Output the result to the standard output (System.out).</p></li></ol><p>This type of code challenge can be eaily tested with different input data formats, so we'll use them often.</p><h5 id="reading-data-with-a-scanner">Reading data with a scanner</h5><p>The simplest method to obtain data from the standard input is using the standard class <code class="language-java">Scanner</code>. It allows a program to read values of various types, like strings or numbers, from the standard input. In this topic, we consider reading data from the input.</p><p>To use this class, you should add the following import statement at the top of your file with the source code.</p><pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;</code></pre><p>After the import, add a class with this construction:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    }
}</code></pre><p>In the <code class="language-java">main</code> method, we make an object of <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> class, which allows us to use its methods. <code class="language-java">System.in</code> signals that the program will read the text that you entered in the standard input. You'll need this line exactly as it is for now.</p><p>The <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> class offers two ways to read strings. If your input is an integer number or a single word, you can use the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method. For example, the following code snippet reads the user's name and prints a <em>hello</em> message:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String name = scanner.next();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}</code></pre><p>For example, if the user enters their name as James, the program's output will be:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, James!</code></pre><p>If you enter an integer number like 123 as the user's input, the program will output this number. Remember that the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method will store 123 or some other integer number as a string, even if we know that this string represents a number.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, 123!</code></pre><p>Now, what if a user inputs a compound name like Erich Maria? The program will only output the first word:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, Erich!</code></pre><p>In this case, you'll need to invoke the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method again:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String firstName = scanner.next(); // "Erich"
        String lastName = scanner.next(); // "Maria"
        System.out.println("Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName  + "!");
    }
}</code></pre><p>However, it would be more efficient to use another method, the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method, which reads and outputs the entire line:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, Erich Maria!</code></pre><p>You may notice that the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method only reads a single word and excludes any whitespace. On the other hand, the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method includes all space characters it encounters.</p><p>Note that in Java, <strong>whitespace</strong> includes not just the space character, but also everything that appears empty when printed: a tab, the newline character, and other non-printing characters.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss space and newline characters: essentially, we create a corresponding character when we press Enter and start a new line. The term "whitespace" refers to either of these. A more correct term for what we've been calling a "word" is a <strong>token</strong>, which can be described as a piece of text surrounded by whitespace. So we can say that the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method locates and returns the next token, while the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> reads all data till the end of the current line.</p><h5 id="reading-a-multiline-input">Reading a multiline input</h5><p>Reading multiline input might be a bit complicated; you need to consider the cursor's position and the behavior of the reading methods.</p><p>Let's explore this with an example:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">|This is a simple

multiline input,

that is being read
</code></pre><p><strong>|</strong> indicates the cursor's position before reading the input.</p><p>If we call the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method, the program will read the input up to the whitespace:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This| is a simple

multiline input,

that is being read
</code></pre><p>After invoking the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method, the program reads the remaining line starting from the whitespace. If there is such a line in your input, the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> places the cursor at the start of the new line:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is a simple

|multiline input,

that is being read
</code></pre><p>Next, let's invoke the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method two times. The first input is indicated by the position of the cursor which is right after the word and before the whitespace:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is a simple

multiline| input,

that is being read
</code></pre><p>We're now invoking the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method once again. The program outputs the second word in the line <em>without</em> any whitespace. The number of space characters doesn't matter, as the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method will skip the whitespace until it finds the next token.</p><p>As you'll see, the cursor's position remains at the current line, just before the new line and after the comma:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is a simple

multiline input,|

that is being read
</code></pre><p>Here's a tricky thing about the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method, which also shows a major difference between <code class="language-java">next()</code> and <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> methods. As you know already, the program will read input from the cursor's position to the new line (again, if such a line exists in your input). In this example, the cursor is placed before the new line. This means the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method will return an empty line ("") and place the cursor at the start of a new line.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is a simple

multiline input,

|that is being read</code></pre><p>To sum it all up, let's look at the entire code and consider what variables we've just read:</p><pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner; 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  

        String word1 = scanner.next(); // "This"
        String line1 = scanner.nextLine(); // " is a simple" 
        String word2 = scanner.next(); // "multiline"
        String word3 = scanner.next(); // "input,"
        String line2 = scanner.nextLine(); // "" 
    }
}</code></pre><p>This example may seem a bit artificial, but it should assist you in understanding the difference between these two methods—remember that usually, variables have more expressive names.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>You can read data from the standard input with a specialized <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> class. The <code class="language-java">next()</code> and <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> methods help you read strings. Both are used for gathering input, but they act differently. The <code class="language-java">next()</code> method reads input until the next whitespace, while the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method reads input to the end of the line.</p><p>We suggest using the <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> class when solving programming challenges—it is one of the simplest ways to obtain values from the standard input.</p>
