<h2>Access modifiers</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>You've probably seen the following piece of code:  </p><pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) { 
    // some code goes here
}</code></pre><p>Ever wondered why the word "public" is used? It means that the <code class="language-java">main(...)</code> method is available to everyone. The word <code class="language-java">public</code> is an <strong>access modifier</strong>, a special keyword that specifies who is allowed to use your code or a part of it. It can be placed in front of any field, method, or class.</p><p>So, you already know at least one of the access modifiers! The others are: <code class="language-java">package-private</code>, <code class="language-java">protected</code>, and <code class="language-java">private</code>. Why do we need them? Let's find out.</p><h5 id="ok-so-why-should-i-use-them">OK, so why should I use them?</h5><p>There are two main reasons to take access under control: clarity and safety of code.</p><p><strong>Code clarity.</strong> Imagine your code is an engine of a washing machine with functions such as choosing a washing program or starting a washing process. How can we help the user figure out how to wash their clothes? We can cover the engine with the body and add buttons for choosing a washing mode and starting the process. The user doesn't need to know what is going on inside the machine’s body; the buttons to get the result are more than enough.</p><p>That’s how access control helps in code – you can <strong>“hide” the engine from the user </strong>by restricting access and simply providing them with the public “buttons”.</p><p><strong>Code safety. </strong>Now imagine you have developed a rather useful library that is used by other developers. One day Jane Doe wants to use your code’s functionality in her project, but the problem is that she needs to change one variable in one of your classes. If it is public, nothing can stop her from doing that in her code before using method A from the library.</p><p>What can happen if the variable is used somewhere in method B? The B method would probably start to act unpredictably. So, protecting important parts of your code is a guarantee that it will be<strong> used as an unmodifiable part </strong>and its behavior will be the exact one you have developed it for.</p><h5 id="public-and-package-private-classes">Public and package-private classes</h5><p>When you manage the access in your code, you divide objects of your program into two groups: top-level and low-level items. Fields and methods that are explicitly used outside the class are called top-level fields and methods. If fields and methods are used inside the class, they are known as low-level ones. This low-level and top-level logic is also applicable to classes.<br/>Usually, using low-level items helps to unload top-level classes, methods, or fields to structure and decompose the code. If these items are not explicitly used, it will be efficient to restrict access to them.</p><p>Now let’s see how we can set restrictions to different parts of the code: a top-level class can have one of two following modifiers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>package-private (default, no explicit modifier): </strong>visible only for classes from the same package;</p></li><li><p><strong>public:</strong> visible to all classes everywhere.</p></li></ul><p>Here is a class inside the package <code class="language-java">org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory.p1</code>. with default package-private access:</p><pre><code class="language-java">package org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory.p1;

class PackagePrivateClass{

}</code></pre><p>This class can be used only by other classes from the same package. It's not even visible for classes from any other package:</p><pre><code class="language-java">org.hyperskill

org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory

default package</code></pre><p>Note the first two examples – if the class is package-private in package <code class="language-java">a.b</code>, it is still unavailable from package <code class="language-java">a.c</code> and package <code class="language-java">a</code> itself.</p><p>Here is a public class inside the package <code class="language-java">org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory.p2</code></p><pre><code class="language-java">package org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory.p2;

public class PublicClass {

}</code></pre><p>This class has no access restrictions, it is visible to all classes and can be used everywhere:</p><pre><code class="language-java">org.hyperskill

org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory

org.hyperskill.java.packages.theory.p1

default package</code></pre><p>The common way of using top-level class modifiers is:</p><ol><li><p>make the classes containing methods for users (the “buttons”) <strong>public</strong>;</p></li><li><p>make all other classes with low-level logic methods used by public ones <strong>package-private</strong> (cover the engine with the body).</p></li></ol><p>Remember: everything that’s not meant to be used/changed by classes from other packages should not be public.</p><h5 id="private-members">Private members</h5><p>A class member (a field or a method, e.g. class constructor) has more options to choose from: <strong>private</strong>, <strong>package-private</strong>, <strong>protected</strong>, and <strong>public</strong>. Let's consider member modifiers in more detail.</p><p>Fields are often declared <strong>private </strong>to control access to them from any other class. In some cases, these fields are only used internally in the class and there is no way to change or even access them from any other class. In other cases, it can be done via <strong>accessor methods </strong>(e.g. getters and setters). <strong>Getter</strong> and <strong>setter</strong> methods are used to protect and hide your data when creating classes. A getter method returns the value of a field, while a setter method sets or updates the value. We will discuss the main features of getter and setter methods in further topics.</p><p>Private methods are used to hide the internal low-level logic implementation from the rest of the code and make public methods more brief and readable.</p><p>Here is the class <code class="language-java">Counter</code> with the private field <code class="language-java">current</code>. This field can be read with the method <code class="language-java">getCurrent()</code> , a getter method, and changed with the <code class="language-java">inc()</code> method. The last one is not exactly a setter method because it doesn't manually set a value to a <code class="language-java">current</code> variable, but just increments it.</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Counter {
   private long current = 0;

   public long getCurrent() {
       return this.current;
   }


   public void inc() {
       inc(1L);
   }


   private void inc(long val) {
       this.current += val;
   }
}</code></pre><p>Sometimes, a private class constructor is required. This type of constructor can only be used inside the class, e.g. from another constructor, which can be public or private, or from the class methods.</p><h5 id="package-private-members">Package-private members</h5><p>A<strong> package-private</strong> access modifier does not require any keyword. If a field, a method, or a constructor has this modifier, then it can be read or changed from any class inside the same package.</p><p>Let's see an example: here are two classes in the same package: <code class="language-java">Salary</code> and <code class="language-java">Promotion</code>.</p><p>The class <code class="language-java">Salary</code> has a package-private field and a constructor. An instance of the <code class="language-java">Salary</code> class can be created inside a <code class="language-java">Promotion</code> class, and the field can also be accessed by <code class="language-java">Promotion</code> and its members because they belong to the same package.</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Salary {
    long income;

    Salary(long income) {
        this.income = income;
    }
}

public class Promotion {
    Salary salary;

    Promotion(Salary salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public void promote() {
        salary.income += 1500;
    }
}</code></pre><h5 id="protected-and-public-members">Protected and public members</h5><p>Disclaimer: you will learn to use these two modifiers later!</p><p>A <strong>protected </strong>access modifier means that a class member can be accessed from classes inside the same package and all subclasses of this class. For now, it is important to remember that the protected option is less restricting than package-private.</p><p>A<strong> public</strong> access modifier means that there is no restriction on using a field, method, or class. It's often used for constructors, and methods representing the class API but not commonly used with fields.</p><p>Here are common ways to understand which access modifier to choose. It is not the ultimate algorithm, but it can help you understand the main use cases of the modifiers.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="access modifier selection schemes" height="376" src="https://ucarecdn.com/e52d3eca-5e12-42b5-b414-a11d88c3cab5/" width="860"/></picture></p><p>Let's review the names of access modifiers (from most to least limiting):</p><ul><li><p><strong>private</strong> — available only inside a class;</p></li><li><p><strong>package-private</strong> (also known as <strong>default</strong>, implicit) — available for all classes in the same package;</p></li><li><p><strong>protected</strong> — available for classes in the same package and for subclasses (will be covered later);</p></li><li><p><strong>public </strong>— available for all classes everywhere.</p></li></ul><p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="modifier comparison table" height="194" src="https://ucarecdn.com/cf2b948a-2ab0-4ae7-9213-fe023838ea0e/" width="498"/></picture></p><p>The table illustrates the level of access provided by the access modifiers: the class always has access to its members, and so on. Note that by a subclass here, we mean only a subclass of this class used in another package.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p></p><p>Remember that only <strong>public</strong> or default (no keywords) modifiers may be used when declaring non-nested classes. All four of them can be applied to class members: fields, methods, etc.</p><p></p></div><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>In this topic, you learned about access modifiers that allow you to determine who will be able to use the code. Using them makes your code safer and clearer. In conclusion, here is a piece of advice: use the most restrictive access level that makes sense for a particular member. Don't make all members public.</p>
